1. Make it work (basic grounded solution).
    - Visualize the problem as a tree;
    - Implement the tree using recursion;
    - Test it.

2. Make it efficient.
    - Add a memo object (has keys as args and
    values as a return value of a function);
    - Add a base case to return memo values;
    - Store return values into the memo.
